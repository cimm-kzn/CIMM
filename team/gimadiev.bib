abstract = {Here, we report the data visualization, analysis and modeling for a large set of 4830 SN2 reactions the rate constant of which (logk) was measured at different experimental conditions (solvent, temperature). The reactions were encoded by one single molecular graph – Condensed Graph of Reactions, which allowed us to use conventional chemoinformatics techniques developed for individual molecules. Thus, Matched Reaction Pairs approach was suggested and used for the analyses of substituents effects on the substrates and nucleophiles reactivity. The data were visualized with the help of the Generative Topographic Mapping approach. Consensus Support Vector Regression (SVR) model for the rate constant was prepared. Unbiased estimation of the model's performance was made in cross‐validation on reactions measured on unique structural transformations. The model's performance in cross‐validation (RMSE=0.61 logk units) and on the external test set (RMSE=0.80) is close to the noise in data. Performances of the local models obtained for selected subsets of reactions proceeding in particular solvents or with particular type of nucleophiles were similar to that of the model built on the entire set. Finally, four different definitions of model's applicability domains for reactions were examined.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature We report the first direct QSPR modeling of equilibrium constants of tautomeric transformations (logK T ) in different solvents and at different temperatures, which do not require intermediate assessment of acidity (basicity) constants for all tautomeric forms. The key step of the modeling consisted in the merging of two tautomers in one sole molecular graph (“condensed reaction graph”) which enables to compute molecular descriptors characterizing entire equilibrium. The support vector regression method was used to build the models. The training set consisted of 785 transformations belonging to 11 types of tautomeric reactions with equilibrium constants measured in different solvents and at different temperatures. The models obtained perform well both in cross-validation (Q 2 = 0.81 RMSE = 0.7 logK T units) and on two external test sets. Benchmarking studies demonstrate that our models outperform results obtained with DFT B3LYP/6-311 ++ G(d,p) and ChemAxon Tautomerizer applicable only in water at room temperature.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA, Weinheim Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) approach was successfully used to visualize, analyze and model the equilibrium constants (KT) of tautomeric transformations as a function of both structure and experimental conditions. The modeling set contained 695 entries corresponding to 350 unique transformations of 10 tautomeric types, for which KT values were measured in different solvents and at different temperatures. Two types of GTM-based classification models were trained: first, a “structural” approach focused on separating tautomeric classes, irrespective of reaction conditions, then a “general” approach accounting for both structure and conditions. In both cases, the cross-validated Balanced Accuracy was close to 1 and the clusters, assembling equilibria of particular classes, were well separated in 2-dimentional GTM latent space. Data points corresponding to similar transformations measured under different experimental conditions, are well separated on the maps. Additionally, GTM-driven regression models were found to have their predictive performance dependent on different scenarios of the selection of local fragment descriptors involving special marked atoms (proton donors or acceptors). The application of local descriptors significantly improves the model performance in 5-fold cross-validation: RMSE=0.63 and 0.82 logKT units with and without local descriptors, respectively. This trend was as well observed for SVR calculations, performed for the comparison purposes.},

abstract = {We describe a novel approach of reaction representation as a combination of two mixtures: a mixture of reactants and a mixture of products. In turn, each mixture can be encoded using an earlier reported approach involving simplex descriptors (SiRMS). The feature vector representing these two mixtures results from either concatenated product and reactant descriptors or the difference between descriptors of products and reactants. This reaction representation doesn't need an explicit labeling of a reaction center. The rigorous “product-out” cross-validation (CV) strategy has been suggested. Unlike the na{\"{i}}ve “reaction-out” CV approach based on a random selection of items, the proposed one provides with more realistic estimation of prediction accuracy for reactions resulting in novel products. The new methodology has been applied to model rate constants of E2 reactions. It has been demonstrated that the use of the fragment control domain applicability approach significantly increases prediction accuracy of the models. The models obtained with new “mixture” approach performed better than those required either explicit (Condensed Graph of Reaction) or implicit (reaction fingerprints) reaction center labeling.},
