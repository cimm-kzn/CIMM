The Third Kazan Summer School on Chemoinformatics (**KSSCI2017**) was held in **Kazan**, Russia, from **5th** to **7th July 2017**.

**The Book of abstracts** accepted for presentation in 3rd Kazan Summer School
on Chemoinformatics is available under the `link <https://seafile.cimm.site/f/bc0594d30be04e308512/?dl=1>`_.

**ABOUT THIRD KAZAN SUMMER SCHOOL ON CHEMOINFORMATICS**

Every **2** years, Kazan Summer School on Chemoinformatics welcomes young scientists from all over the world for learning
basics of chemoinformatics and related disciplines, having tutorials on “gold standard” software, and discussing the scientific and industrial achievements.

The **Chemoinformatics** is a new and highly demanded multidisciplinary domain of modern chemistry, that is on the
intersection of chemistry, biology, mathematics and informatics. The main aims of this domain are storing and management of
chemical information and its applying to create compounds, reactions and materials having desired features.

Chemoinformatics is widely used to create new drugs for medical and veterinary purposes, as well as innovative materials,
catalysts, reagents for the chemical industry. Despite the large potential demand for specialists in Chemoinformatics,
educational programs of this discipline in Russia are not yet quite developed. In 2012 in `Kazan Federal University (KFU) <http://kpfu.ru>`_
the `Master program of Chemoinformatics <http://kpfu.ru/chemistry/abiturientam/napravleniya-i-profili-podgotovki/magistratura/hemoinformatika>`_ has been opened,
which has now become the third active educational program of Chemoinformatics in the world. In Russia, similar programs were
recently opened in ITMO University (Saint-Peterburg) and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (Moscow).

This School is the **Third Summer School on Chemoinformatics** in Kazan, `the first one <http://kpfu.ru/chemistry/nauchno-issledovatelskaya-rabota/konferencii-i-seminary/kazan-summer-school-on-chemoinformatics>`_
took place in **2013** and united about *90* participants from **7** countries. *12* lectures, *4* tutorials and *10* oral
reports were presented in the School. `The Second Kazan Summer School on Chemoinformatics <http://kpfu.ru/chemistry/nauchno-issledovatelskaya-rabota/konferencii-i-seminary/kssci2>`_
attracted more than *100* participants from **16** countries. *19* lectures, *4* tutorials and *4* oral reports were presented there.

**KSSCI2017** aimed to create the conditions for training specialists of Chemoinformatics in Russia, as well as to create
an educational and scientific environment for scientists, pharmaceutical and chemical industry representatives, IT specialists and software developers.

**The main topics of the School are:**

- Basics of chemoinformatics and QSAR approaches,
- Sources of chemical information, its storage and retrieval,
- SAR/QSAR/QSPR modeling,
- Structure-based drug design.

**Program of the event includes:**

- Lectures of world-leaders in chemoinformatics
- Plenary presentations on cutting-edge approaches
- Oral reports about personal achievements of young participants
- Poster session
- Tutorials
